Version 0.1.1:
2022-12-21  Emmanuel Gil Peyrot <linkmauve@linkmauve.fr>
    * Visible changes:
        - Add a serialiser, so we can write files back, for instance using
        another texture format.
        - Decoding textures is now much faster, thanks to using our own
        homebrew TGA decoding, parallelised on threads.
    * Internal changes:
        - Remove the nom dependency, instead parse manually using Read.
        - Improve GL renderer internals.
        - Split out VBO and program handling into their own modules.
        - Disable mipmap generation for now, as it would slow things down
        tremendously on mobile.
